# Affine Cipher Cryptanalysis Known Plaintext

This repository hosts my codes that are related to affine cipher cryptanalysis with known plaintext. There is also code for brute force and exhaustive key code method to crack the key. The `affinecipher.jpeg` is supposedly the ciphertext that will be cracked, `known_plaintext` and `known_ciphertext` is containing self-explanatory binary of known data.
